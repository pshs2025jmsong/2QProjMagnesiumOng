						<h2>History</h2>
						
						<br><hr><br>
						
						<p>
							The construction of the Forbidden City began in 1406 when Hongwu Emperor's son Zhu Di became the Yongle Emperor and moved the capital
							from Nanjing to Beijing.
							
							<br><br>
							
							Previously home to 24 emperors, 14 of the Ming dynasty and 10 of the Qing dynasty, the Forbidden City ended its reputation being the
							political center of China in 1912 due to the abdication of Puyi, the last Emperor of China. An agreement under the new Republic of
							China government states that Puyi would remain in the Inner Court while the Outer Court was given over to public use. In 1924, Puyi
							was evicted after a coup. A year later, the Palace Museum would be established in the Forbidden City.
							
							<br><br>
							
							In 1933, the Japanese invaded China, which forced the evacuation of the national treasures in the Forbidden City. A portion of the 
							treasures were returned after World War II, while the other part was kept in Taiwan under orders of Chiang Kai-shek, whose political
							party was losing the Chinese Civil War. The treasures kept in Taiwan remained there until 1965 and became the core of the National
							Palace Museum in Taipei.
							
							<br><br>
							
							In 1949, the establishment of People's Republic of China caused a revolutionary zeal, which caused some damage to the Forbidden City.
							During the Cultural Revolution, further destruction was prevented when an army battalion was sent by Premier Zhou Enlai to guard the
							city.
							
							<br><br>
							
							In 1987, the Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Forbidden City is currently administered by the Palace
							Museum, which is carrying out a restoration to restore all buildings to their pre-1912 state.
