						<p>
							This country, as mentioned earlier, have an enormous number of skyscrapers and buildings that light up the night sky. The places below
							are the some of the most places that are worthy of appreciation.
						</p>
						
						<br>
						
						<ul>
							<li><i>Merlion Park</i> - This landmark is one of the most popular tourist spots in Singapore. The statue is that of a mythical
							creature with the head of a lion and the body of a fish. This mythical creature is bound  in Singapore's culture.</li>
							<li><i>Supertree Grove</i> - A famous landmark in Singapore, The Supertree Grove is one of the most photographed places in Singapore.
							At first glance, this attraction may look like that it has no major purpose, but it actually has a purpose--these mimic the function
							of a real tree. The grove also does collect water from monsoons and distribute the water to irrigation systems. Very useful and
							beautiful!</li>
							<li><i>Marina Bay Sands</i> - The most well-known building in Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands, would fill you with wanderlust.
							Three giant columns illuminate the night sky. The platform on the top is a great place to get a bird's eye view of the surroundings.</li>
							<li><i>Kranji War Memorial</i> - Back in 1942, one of the axis powers (specifically Japan) invaded the Malay Peninsula. Singapore
							was a stronghold for the British; so when the Japanese invaded Singapore, it resulted with the capture of Singapore. It was considered
							to be the "worst disaster in British military history" by Winston Churchill.</li>
						</ul>
